# Hospital Management System

This is my second task in Brainwave Matrix Intern which is to develop a sophisticated Java program to manage various aspects of a hospital or healthcare facility. This system should include modules for patient registration, appointment scheduling, electronic health records (EHR), billing and invoicing, inventory management for medical supplies, and staff management.

Program files and screenshots related to the project can be found inside the java file.
